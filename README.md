Flight Fare Prediction Analysis

The Flight Fare Prediction Adataset typically comprises various features related to flight bookings, such as deoarture and arrival locations, dates, times, airlines, and possibly additional factors like number of stops, class, etc. The Dataset is used for predicting the fare or price of a flight ticket based on these features. t's commonly utilized in machine learning tasks to develop models that can accurately forecast flight ticket prices, helping travelers plan their trips more efficiently and aiding airlines and travel agencies in pricing strategies.

Below some feature summarry in short 
Airline: Encompasses a range of airlines such as Indigo, Jet Airways, and Air India.
Date_of_Journey: Indicates the date when the passenger's travel begins.
Source: Names the location from which the passenger's journey starts.
Destination: Specifies the location where the passenger's journey ends.
Route: Lists the locations from which the passenger's journey would begin.
Departure Time: Duration of the flight, representing the time it takes to travel from point A to point B.
Arrival Time: Indicates the number of stops the flight will make over its journey.
Duration: Duration of the flight in hours.
Total_Stops: Total number of stops in the journey.
Additional Info: Indicates whether a meal is included with the journey or not.

The Flight Fare Prediction project aimed to predict flight charges using various machine learning algorithms. After thorough experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, the XGBoost regressor emerged as the most effective model, outperforming others with an impressive R2 score of 83%. By minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), it demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting flight fares. Consequently, the XGBoost regressor was selected as the final model for the task, ensuring successful completion of the project.
